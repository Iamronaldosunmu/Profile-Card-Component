## My process
I started off by identifying the components that I'd need to build.
I built each component seperately and put them all together in the final result.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned how to arrange components properly in a component using flex.

### Continued development
I've worked on so many projects already but I just started uploading them to my github. I can't wait for you guys to have a look!

### Useful resources

Mosh hamedani's ultimate Html and Css course was the biggest resource for this project.
